Eat-Da-Burger! A restaurant style app using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM that allows a users to keep track of tasty burgers they would like to eat or have eaten.  User can input a burger to add to the list of burgers to eat.  Once the user has been able to consume this tasty treat, they can then press the "Eat Me!" button to move the burger to the "Burger's Destroyed" list.  If a user was not a fan of the consumed burger, and would rather forget about the experience they can simply click "Delete" to remove it from the database.
